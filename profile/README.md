## Overview

It operates under a single premise: 
**Magic Already Exists.** It's just in the form of science, and people tend to find effort boring.

**Thaumatech** is a personal initiative exploring low-level Computer Science. As I study **magic** I'll develop my own, which will be published here as open source projects.

## Intent

This space serves as a library of experiments, tools, and ideas, built entirely in **_C_**.

My intention for Thaumatech is to one day have built every tool for my own custom workflow, like my own advanced terminal based text-editors like vim, and my own advanced version control systems like git.

#### Currently In Development

       ‣ _Inspired by:_ `gdb`

- [ ] **Rune**
       ‣ _What it does:_ Terminal-based text editor 
       ‣ _Inspired by:_ `vim`

- [ ] **Linux Distro**
       ‣ _What it does:_ Customized Linux distribution
       ‣ _Inspired by:_ `Arch`

## Author

Thaumatech is maintained by <a href="https://justin06lee.dev" target="_blank">me</a>, a developer interested in low-level systems programming, and cares a bit too much about their dev environment and workflow.

This is not a company, a studio, or an organization — just a guy with an interest in building things and reinventing the wheel but better(in my completely unbiased opinion).
