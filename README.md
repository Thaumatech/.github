## Overview

**Thaumatech** is a personal initiative exploring low-level Computer Science. As I study **magic** I'll develop my own, which will be published here as open source projects.

It operates under a single premise:  
**Magic Already Exists.** It's just in the form of science, and people tend to find effort boring.

## Intent

This space serves as a library of experiments, tools, and ideas.

My intention for Thaumatech is to one day have built every tool for my own custom workflow, like my own advanced terminal based text-editors like vim, and my own advanced version control systems like git.

#### Currently In Development

- [ ] **Forge**  
  ‣ *What it does:* Build automation tool  
  ‣ *Inspired by:* `make`

#### Future Plans

- [ ] **Terminal-based Text Editor**  
  ‣ *What it does:* Text/code editing in terminal  
  ‣ *Inspired by:* `vim`

- [ ] **Version Control System**  
  ‣ *What it does:* Tracks changes across files  
  ‣ *Inspired by:* `git`

- [ ] **Linux Distro**  
  ‣ *What it does:* Customized Linux distribution  
  ‣ *Inspired by:* `Arch`, `Nix`

- [ ] **Operating System**  
  ‣ *What it does:* Full OS kernel and userland
  ‣ *Inspired by:* `Linux`, `Redox`, etc.

## Author

Thaumatech is maintained by <a href="https://sehnsucht-nach-einer-ehefrau.vercel.app" target="_blank">me</a>, a developer interested in low-level systems programming, and cares a bit too much about their dev environment and workflow.

This is not a company, a studio, or an organization — just a guy with an interest in building things and reinventing the wheel but better(in my completely unbiased opinion).
